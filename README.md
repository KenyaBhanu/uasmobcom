A simple note app.

This note app was made because it is simple and fulfills all the requirements.
When launched, there is an empty screen with a floating button on the bottom right.
Tap the button to open another page in which you can add a note and the title of the note. When it is done, tap the done button on the top right corner.
After said button is tapped, it will go back to the main screen and the new note appears on the page.
The existing note is supposed to be able to be edited but errors have occured and it took a few days to fix. It is not even fixed until now.
The app uses recycler view so new notes will appear under the existing notes on the main screen.
